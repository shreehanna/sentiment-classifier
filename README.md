# 🧠 Sentiment Classifier  
*A no-frills sentiment analysis mini project — built to learn, not just to flex.*

---

## 📌 Why I Made This  
I'm currently learning Machine Learning and NLP as part of my **B.Tech CSE (AI/ML)** journey — prepping for a **USC transfer** and aiming for that **Apple ML internship**.  
This was my hands-on intro to NLP where I got text to stop being cute and start being data.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works  
- **Text to Numbers**: Uses `CountVectorizer` to convert sentences into feature vectors  
- **Model**: Trains a `LogisticRegression` classifier to detect sentiment  
- **Labels**:  
  - `1` = positive 😄  
  - `0` = negative 😡  
- **Prediction**: You input a sentence, it tells you the mood — straight up.

## 🔮 What I Learned  
- NLP basics: tokenization, vectorization  
- How supervised models like logistic regression work  
- End-to-end flow: clean data → train → predict → print it pretty  
- Git + GitHub workflows with PyCharm

---

## 🔧 What’s Next?  
- Make the model smarter with more diverse data  
- Add neutral/mixed class  
- Try other models (Naive Bayes, SVM)  
- Build a clean UI with **Streamlit** *(coming soon...)*

## 🧪 Example Output  
😄 Positive → "I love The Devil Wears Prada"
😡 Negative → "This is Trash"

## 💬 Final Word  
All code and logic written by **me** while learning Python + ML from scratch.  
I used ChatGPT only to review structure and explain concepts I didn’t know at first —  
**no copy-paste**, I understand every line in here.
