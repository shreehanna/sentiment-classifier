# 🧠 Sentiment Classifier

> A no-frills sentiment analysis mini project — built to learn, not just to flex.

## 📌 Why I Made This

I'm currently learning Machine Learning and NLP as part of my B.Tech CSE (AI/ML) journey — prepping for a USC transfer + aiming for that Apple ML internship. This was my hands-on intro to NLP where I got text to stop being cute and start being data.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Text to Numbers:** Uses `CountVectorizer` to convert sentences into feature vectors  
- **Model:** Trains a `LogisticRegression` classifier to detect sentiment  
- **Labels:** 1 = positive 😄, 0 = negative 😡  
- **Prediction:** You input a sentence, it tells you the mood — straight up.

🔮 What I Learned
NLP basics: tokenization, vectorization

How supervised models like logistic regression work

End-to-end flow: clean data → train → predict → print it pretty

Git + GitHub workflows with PyCharm

🔧 What’s Next?
Make the model smarter with more diverse data

Add neutral/mixed class

Try other models (Naive Bayes, SVM)

Build a clean UI with Streamlit (coming soon...)

💬 Final Word
All code and logic written by me while learning Python + ML from scratch.
I used ChatGPT only to review structure and explain concepts I didn’t know at first — no copy-paste, I understand every line in here.

## 🧪 Example Output

```python
😄 Positive → "I love The Devil Wears Prada"
😡 Negative → "This is Trash"
