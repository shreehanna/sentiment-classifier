🔮 What I Learned
NLP basics: tokenization, vectorization

How supervised models like logistic regression work

End-to-end flow: clean data → train → predict → print it pretty

Git + GitHub workflows with PyCharm

🔧 What’s Next?
Make the model smarter with more diverse data

Add neutral/mixed class

Try other models (Naive Bayes, SVM)

Build a clean UI with Streamlit (coming soon...)

💬 Final Word
All code and logic written by me while learning Python + ML from scratch.
I used ChatGPT only to review structure and explain concepts I didn’t know at first — no copy-paste, I understand every line in here.
